This software creates an embedded web server using Java's
built-in HttpServer class and some additional class libraries.
The server can be run in a docker container.  It provides a
web server that can produce a single HTML page and a single
image containing a graph.  The HTML page uses forms so that
various parameters can be updated, at which point a new
graph is generated.

The graph shows the results of running a simple epidemiological
model, allowing the user to get a sense of how sensitive the
behavior is to changes in various parameters.

The software (trivial as it may be) was developed as follows:

    1. The author spent a half hour in mid-March, 2020 creating
    a simple epidemiologicl model to get an idea of what would
    happen during the COVID-19 pandemic, as his county decided
    to close everything down.  The model convinced him that a
    month of inconvenience was a very optimistic assessment and
    that the problems would go on for a lot longer, as it did.

    2. The author then put this code into an embedded web server
    as a test of a servlet-compatibility feature.

    3. Then a docker file was added, also as a test.

    4. While written primarily for testing, the author guessed that
    the software might be useful to someone for getting a sense of
    why various decisions are being made by local and state goverments:
    those decisions are more understandable if you see how sensitive
    the outcome is to changes in various parameters.
